      <h2>Sonder Son 2017 </h2>
      <p>This is the album’s high point and what should guide Faiyaz as he develops as a writer. Sonder Son has the same highly intimate, nothing-to-lose quality of Frank Ocean’s Nostalgia, Ultra. but could use more of its experimental spirit. 
          <br>
          <br>
          
    What is refreshing, however, is that it does not kowtow to radio trends, the dejected filth of a Ty Dolla $ign or PARTYNEXTDOOR, whose partying is often a coverup for pain. Here, current pain is lived in and past pain is just one small recollection away.</p>

      <h2>Into 2017</h2>
      <p>In an interview with Atlanta radio station, V-103, Faiyaz stated that their project only took a week to manifest because of the instantaneous vibe and connection of the group. All of them have similar musical influences, so it was easy for them to take that and create something. 
          <br>
          <br>
          
    The project churned out to be an EP titled, Into, which was released in January of this year. Standing at 7 tracks long, it’s a journey full of ambitious songs about love and life. Faiyaz sings heavenly over quiet guitars, soft drums, and delicate piano. His voice is always the most attention-grabbing element in the songs, which makes it sound so incredible. The project also is adventurous with its instrumentation; containing a few danceable beat breakdowns between songs. Overall, no song is without purpose, theme, or passion. Highlights from the EP are “Too Fast” and “Searchin.”</p>

      <h2>A.M Paradox 2017</h2>
      <p>When end of the year lists are done for 2016 and people start naming their favorites and “Rookies of the Year,” Brent Faiyaz might want to make your list.
<br>
The Maryland-made but L.A.-based triple threat writer-singer-producer has had arguably a breakout year, first unveiling himself with “Poison” (which we featured in our “The Pulse” segment) and then contributing to bringing soul back to RnB by serving as one-third of the music group, Sonder. On Tuesday (his 21st birthday), Faiyaz went one step further, by releasing his debut EP, A.M. Paradox.
<br>
          <br>
Unsurprisingly, Faiyaz’s breakout single, “Poison,” is amongst A.M.’s five tracks. On the production front, Paradox bears assists help from Ben Free, Sonder, Pablo Dylan, James Harte and Paperboy Fabe on the boards. And with a run time of just over twenty minutes, the EP milks every single second with an array of beautiful sounds.
<br>
          <br>
Brent Faiyaz’s strength is his falsetto. It’s what allows him to float over the guitar strums and lush layered instrumentation of intro track “Lovely,” the singer’s voice dripping pure admiration as he sings, “Look at you now” when he takes in all of his lover visually. It’s what allows him to begin off standout cut “Insecure” as just gentle musings before letting his high note go to work on the track’s hook.</p>

      <h2>Lost 2018 </h2>
      <p>Lost is more vulnerable and succinct than Sonder Son, a charming introduction that probed his upbringing. It starts on “Why’z It So Hard” with an unflinching reflection on race and injustice. Over complicated crisscrossing harmonies and a beat that seems to droop beneath its own sadness, he reflects on being marginalized and degraded as a young black man: “Why they wanna see me dead?/I ain’t even grown yet/Baby, you got too much to offer/That’s prolly why they want you in a coffin.” He’s speaking to power dynamics that hover like a guillotine and how black brilliance is treated as a threat to white hegemony. During “Came Right Back,” his soft voice stretches over scintillating guitars and uneasy piano chords covered in static.
          <br>
          <br>
    The deconstructed ballad soon disappears into a conversation where Faiyaz ponders the burdens of promise. Lost is a wunderkind’s search for catharsis, a quest to find his voice while battling demons of self-doubt.</p>
