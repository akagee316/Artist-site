        If you’re unaware of who Brent Faiyaz is and what he can bring to the table, reminisce about your last late-night car ride, or the last party you went to. You may have heard “Crew,” a song by fellow DMV artist Goldlink with assisting vocals from Shy Glizzy and Faiyaz. 
        
        <br>
        The song was released in December of last year, but thanks to a smart placement and a remix with Gucci Mane, it’s been slowly rising on the Billboard 100. As this article is being written, “Crew” is currently on ranked 46th on the acclaimed chart. For most, this was people’s initial introduction to Brent Faiyaz. This unforeseen hit revealed Faiyaz to the masses, allowing him to garner new fans of his own.
